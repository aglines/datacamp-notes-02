Dictionaries & Pandas
Learn about the dictionary, an alternative to the Python list, and the pandas DataFrame, the de facto standard to work with tabular data in Python. You will get hands-on practice with creating and manipulating datasets, and youâ€™ll learn how to access the information you need from these data structures.

Logic, Control Flow and Filtering
Boolean logic is the foundation of decision-making in Python programs. Learn about different comparison operators, how to combine them with Boolean operators, and how to use the Boolean outcomes in control structures. You'll also learn to filter data in pandas DataFrames using logic.
Comparison Operators 
Equality 
Greater and less than 
Compare arrays 
Boolean Operators 
and, or, not (1) 
and, or, not (2) 
Boolean operators with NumPy 
if, elif, else 
Warmup 
if 
Add else 
Customize further: elif

Loops
There are several techniques you can use to repeatedly execute Python code. While loops are like repeated if statements, the for loop iterates over all kinds of data structures. Learn all about them in this chapter.
