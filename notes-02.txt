Matplotlib
Data visualization is a key skill for aspiring data scientists. Matplotlib makes it easy to create meaningful and insightful plots. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to build various types of plots, and customize them to be more visually appealing and interpretable.


Matplotlib plots
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

get 2 lists named year, pop

plt.plot(year, pop) - first is x horiz axis, 2nd is y vert axis
shows the line connecting all the pts, but not the dt pts really themselves

plt.show()

plt.scatter(year, pop)
shows the data pts but no line connecting them
adv - shows the full number of dt pts, which line plot does not

Dictionaries & Pandas
Learn about the dictionary, an alternative to the Python list, and the pandas DataFrame, the de facto standard to work with tabular data in Python. You will get hands-on practice with creating and manipulating datasets, and you’ll learn how to access the information you need from these data structures.

Logic, Control Flow and Filtering
Boolean logic is the foundation of decision-making in Python programs. Learn about different comparison operators, how to combine them with Boolean operators, and how to use the Boolean outcomes in control structures. You'll also learn to filter data in pandas DataFrames using logic.
Comparison Operators 
Equality 
Greater and less than 
Compare arrays 
Boolean Operators 
and, or, not (1) 
and, or, not (2) 
Boolean operators with NumPy 
if, elif, else 
Warmup 
if 
Add else 
Customize further: elif

Loops
There are several techniques you can use to repeatedly execute Python code. While loops are like repeated if statements, the for loop iterates over all kinds of data structures. Learn all about them in this chapter.
